    <h1>Chemistry Assignment</h1>
    <p>Chemistry is the branch of science that deals with the properties, 
    composition, and behavior of matter. It is a fascinating field that explores 
    the building blocks of the universe.</p>
    <h2>Chemical Element</h2>
    <p>The periodic table is a tabular arrangement of chemical elements.
         Each element is represented by its chemical symbol, 
         such as Fe for iron, H for hydrogen, and O for oxygen. 
         Elements are classified into groups and periods based on their properties.
    </p>
    <h3>Chemical Equations</h3>
    <p>Chemical reactions are represented using <em>chemical equations</em>. 
        Here's an example of a <em>chemical reaction:</em></p>
    <p>2H2+ O2+ 2H2O</p>
    <p>This equation represents the reaction between hydrogen gas <em>(H2)</em>
         and oxygen gas <em>(O2)</em>to form water <em>(H2O)</em>.</p>
    <h4>Important Concepts</h4>
    <p>Stoichiometry is the calculation of reactants and products in chemical reactions. 
        It involves balancing chemical equations to ensure mass and charge are conserved.</p>  
    <p>Subscripts indicate the number of atoms of each element in a molecule,
         while superscripts represent charges or the number of atoms in an ion.</p> 
    <h5>Conclusion</h5>        
    <p>Chemistry plays a crucial role in understanding the world around us. 
        From the composition of the air we breathe to the reactions that power
         our bodies, chemistry influences every aspect of our lives.</p>
